        <h2>Personal Profile</h2>

        <p>
          At age 13 I embarked on the journey of building a computer
          independently. The experience left me utterly captivated for all
          things related technology, resulting in me studying computer science
          at university. My goal is to engage with diverse projects and
          challenges, collaborating with experts in the field to broaden my
          horizons and contribute to cutting-edge innovations within the
          software engineering domain. My primary strength lies in my adept
          problem-solving skills and systematic thinking, which consistently
          lead to the achievement of desired outcomes.

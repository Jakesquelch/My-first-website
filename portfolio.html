      <h2>Project 1</h2>

      <p>
        To the left is a photo of my most recent project. I used polymorphism to
        allow my launcher class to work with a broader variety of objects, and
        you will gain practice with downcasts, used abstract to leave "gaps" to
        be filled by subclasses, and learnt how interfaces give you flexibility
        to create classes outside a rigid inheritance hierarchy.

      <!--also added in brs so that there are sufficient gaps between each project-->

      </form>

      <p>
        To the right is my second project, this one used a Java function to
        schedule calendar appointments, following a test-driven approach. <br> I
        learnt how to follow a test-driven approach to implement new
        functionality, how to write a test case following the Arrange-Act-Assert
        structure and how to use the basic JUnit test assertions.

      <h2>Project 3</h2>
      <p>
        To the left is my third project, i used inheritance to avoid repitition,
        reusing as much code as possible. I learnt how to reuse code across
        classes by inheriting fields and methods from super type, how to
        customize an inherited method (overriding). And how to document the
        behaviour of your classes to make them easier to use (Javadoc comments).
